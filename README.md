# What is Emmet?
# Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, email designers type less, saving both keystrokes and time when building a campaign. Also, relying on Emmetâ€™s autocompletion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust emails.

# Difference between library and framework?
# Frameworks provide ready-to-use tools, standards and templates for fast application development and libraries do not
# Frameworks control the calling of libraries for our code
# Library - A library is like going to Ikea. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You donâ€™t feel like making your own table from scratch. Ikea allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control.

# Framework- A framework, on the other hand, is like building a model home. You have a set of blueprints and a few limited choices when it comes to architecture and design. Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.

# What is CDN and why do we use it?
# A CDN (content delivery network), also called a content distribution network, is a group of geographically distributed and interconnected servers. They provide cached internet content from a network location closest to a user to speed up its delivery. The primary goal of a CDN is to improve web performance by reducing the time needed to send content and rich media to users.


# Why  React is called react?
# React is called React because it is a library that reacts to changes in data and updates the user interface accordingly. It was originally developed by Facebook and was released as an open-source project in 2013. The name "React" reflects its purpose of reacting to changes in data and rendering the appropriate changes in the user interface.

# What is cross origin in the script tag?
# The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

# Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

# A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
